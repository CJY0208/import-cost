# Import Cost

This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package.
The extension utilizes webpack with babili-webpack-plugin in order to detect the imported size.

This project includes implementation of:
 * Import Cost [VSCode extension](packages/vscode-import-cost) - install it from [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)
 * Import Cost [Node module](packages/import-cost) - use freely to implement extensions for other IDE (or contribute them to this repository)

Enjoy!
