# Import Cost [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix/import-cost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix/import-cost) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ko48qav9qqb8fv8u?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shahata/import-cost)

This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package.
The extension utilizes webpack with babili-webpack-plugin in order to detect the imported size.

 * Import Cost [Node module](packages/import-cost) - use freely to implement extensions for other IDE (or contribute them to this repository)

Enjoy!
